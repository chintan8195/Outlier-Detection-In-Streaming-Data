# Outlier-Detection-In-Streaming-Data
The grid-based method is a special case of density-based approach. The idea is to
determine sparse regions in the underlying data in order to report outliers
Histograms can be viewed as 1-dimensional special cases of grid-based method. In
the context of multivariate (i.e., d-dimensional) data, a natural generalization is the
use of grid-structure. Each dimension is partitioned into p equal-width ranges (e.g.,
pd+1 is roughly equal to w, the window size).

### Problem Description
Please implement outlier detection in streaming data using grid-based methodology.You should implement it in Java.

* Your program should take input from stdin. The input contains a window size w (32-bit integer), a host:port pair where you receive an input stream of fixed-ddimensional integer data points in a comma separated values (CSV) format with timestamp added in front. Your program should output outliers starting from the(w+1)th input data until end of input stream. Your program should handle concept drift too.

### Method
 Data points that have density less than t (e.g., ⎡log p⎤) in any particular grid region are reported as outliers. It is often hard to determine the optimal bin-width well. When the bins are too narrow, the normal
data points falling in these bins will be declared outliers; when the bins are too wide,
anomalous data points and high-density regions may be merged into single bin. So,
we need to use small bin-width to find densities of neighboring cells and merge
neighbor cells with density ≥ t together, and points in isolated cell with density < t
are reported as outliers. Both p and t are parameters which need to be tuned for the
application at hand. 
To handle streaming data with sliding window, we extend
density to incremental scenarios: 1. the statistic of the newly inserted data point is
computed, 2. only the density of the affected data points by the newly inserted data
point in the existing data points in the window are updated, and 3. similarly updated
the deleted data points.
